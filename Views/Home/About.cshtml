            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p><strong>Bloomfiy</strong> is a flower boutique dedicated to simple, elegant designs crafted with love. We celebrate the beauty of every bloom — fresh roses, wild daisies, lilies, tulips, and more — combining them to create art that touches hearts.</p>
            <p>We believe that flowers are not just gifts, but emotions — little symbols of care, joy, and connection that speak louder than words.</p>
            <p>Founded in 2018, our journey began with a simple flower stall and a big dream: to bring the beauty of nature into people's lives through thoughtfully designed floral arrangements. Today, we continue to grow while staying true to our roots - focusing on quality, sustainability, and the personal touch that makes every Bloomfiy bouquet special.</p>
