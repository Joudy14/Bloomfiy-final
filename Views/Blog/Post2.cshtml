            <p>Roses are timeless, elegant, and one of the most loved flowers in the world. With proper care, your roses can bloom beautifully and stay healthy year-round.</p>

            <h2>Watering Roses</h2>
            <p>Roses prefer deep, consistent watering at the base of the plant. Avoid wetting the leaves, especially in the evening, to prevent fungal issues.</p>

            <h2>Sunlight Requirements</h2>
            <p>Roses thrive in full sunlight. Aim for at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day to encourage healthy growth and vibrant blooms.</p>

            <h2>Maintenance Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Prune dead or weak stems regularly</li>
                <li>Fertilize during the growing season</li>
                <li>Remove faded flowers to encourage new blooms</li>
                <li>Watch for pests like aphids and treat early</li>
            </ul>

            <p>With the right attention, your roses will reward you with stunning, fragrant blossoms throughout the season.</p>
